    "fullDescription": "Developed a novel image enhancement approach combining multi-histogram equalization with spatial-constrained clustering algorithms (K-Means, FCM, GMM, HDBSCAN) in HSV color space. The system achieves superior contrast enhancement while preserving natural color appearance and avoiding over-enhancement artifacts. Validated on multiple benchmark datasets including KODAK, UCMERCED, and medical imaging collections.",
