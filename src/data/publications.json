    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach for image enhancement using multi-histogram equalization combined with spatial-constrained clustering algorithms. We evaluate four clustering methods (K-Means, FCM, GMM, HDBSCAN) in HSV color space and demonstrate superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets. Our method achieves SSIM scores above 0.92 while maintaining natural color appearance and avoiding over-enhancement artifacts.",
